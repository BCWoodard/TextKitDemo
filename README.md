TextKitDemo
===========
Text Kit is part of the UIKit framework, and it consists of a collection of classes that enable developers to manage text and all of its attributes, as well as to display it in various ways, using new great methods and with a little effort. Indeed, prior to Text Kit and iOS 7, advanced text manipulation was really hard to be performed. In the need of modifying text details, such as font or layout attributes, one had to deal with Core Text, a powerful framework, yet hard to work with. Further than that, only UIWebView views were able to display formatted text. Things became better in iOS 6 with attributed strings, where UITextView views could also display rich text, but yet getting into advanced handling still remained a tricky task.
